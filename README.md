# webdev-bootcamp-htmlportfolio

This is a project for the Web Development Bootcamp (Lesson 28) from Dr. Angela Yu/App Brewery at Udemy.
The objective of this project is to make a website that serves as our own HTML portfolio, using webpages from projects that we made previously, like the Movie Ranking page and the Birthday party invite page.
